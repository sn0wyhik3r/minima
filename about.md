## Whoami ?

Hi, I'm snowyhiker and I'm passionate about **computers**. To get where I am today, I did **2 years** of computer science in high school, and half a year of higher education in **development and programming** ( school and education side ). On the personal side, I've learned a lot on my own through platforms like [**HackTheBox Academy**](https://academy.hackthebox.com/) and [**Vulnlab**](https://www.vulnlab.com/). I've also started certification in **penetration testing**, which is my favorite field. It's been **5 years** since I started on these online platforms.

## My passion for computers

My passion for this practice began when I was **just a child**. My father was tinkering on his computer with [**Windows XP**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP) installed, and I was immediately hooked on this intriguing "machine". That's how I discovered what a computer was back then. What still sticks in my mind today is that **famous [wallpaper](/assets/images/windows_xp.jpg)** he had... It still makes me very **nostalgic**.

In this field, what drives me most is the **adrenalin**. Indeed, when you break into a system and find **vulnerabilities** or **misconfigurations**, I find it **thrilling**. I don't know how to explain it, but I don't think I'm the only one who feels that way. There's also the thirst **to learn**, and to know **as much as possible about a field I'm passionate about.
