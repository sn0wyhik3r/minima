## Whoami ?

Hi, I'm snowyhiker and I'm passionate about **computers**. To get where I am today, I did **2 years** of computer science in high school, and half a year of higher education in **development and programming** ( school and education side ). On the personal side, I've learned a lot on my own through platforms like [**HackTheBox Academy**](https://academy.hackthebox.com/) and [**Vulnlab**](https://www.vulnlab.com/). I've also started certification in **penetration testing**, which is my favorite field. It's been **5 years** since I started on these online platforms.

## My passion for computers

My passion for this practice began when I was **just a child**. My father was tinkering on his computer with [**Windows XP**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP) installed, and I was immediately hooked on this intriguing "machine". That's how I discovered what a computer was back then. What still sticks in my mind today is that **famous [wallpaper](/assets/images/windows_xp.jpg)** he had... It still makes me very **nostalgic**.

In this field, what drives me most is the **adrenalin**. Indeed, when you break into a system and find **vulnerabilities** or **misconfigurations**, I find it **thrilling**. I don't know how to explain it, but I don't think I'm the only one who feels that way. There's also the thirst **to learn**, and to know **as much as possible** about a field I'm passionate about.

## Why did I start this blog ?

I've always loved **sharing** my knowledge with others. I like to share my **new discoveries** with others. That's why I created this blog. To share my different **writeups** for different IT challenges. I also intend to share my experience by writing about different IT certifications. I want you to know that everything I'm going to write is my point of view and **my opinion** on different subjects. So don't take my word for it.

## Target audience

Knowing that there may be some slightly complicated concepts, I recommend an audiance with a **minimum knowledge of IT and cyber security**. For example, during my various posts concerning the explanation of [**CVE's**](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/security/what-is-cve) can go a long way, and can become increasingly complex very quickly.

## Content Overview

The content on this blog will include :

- Explanation and development of various CVEs.
- Writeups on challenges from different platforms and CTFs.
- Development of automation scripts and other tools.
- Presentation and explanation of various topics in cybersecurity.
