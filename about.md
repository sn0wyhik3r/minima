## About Me

Hello! My name is **Federico**, but I’m better known by my online alias **snowyhiker**. I am deeply passionate about technology, particularly in the field of **penetration testing** and **cybersecurity**.

I’ve always been fascinated by how systems work and how they can be made more secure. Over time, this curiosity evolved into a passion for ethical hacking, where I focus on testing and securing digital infrastructures against potential threats.

I believe that in the world of technology, constant learning is key. The more I explore and engage with the field, the more I realize how vast and ever-evolving it is. That’s why I continue to dive deeper into penetration testing, hacking methodologies, and the latest security trends.

When I'm not busy with ethical hacking projects, I enjoy sharing my knowledge and collaborating with others in the tech community. If you're working on a cybersecurity project or just need help, feel free to reach out. I’m always excited to connect with like-minded individuals and contribute to meaningful projects.
