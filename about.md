Hello ! My name is **Federico**, but I’m better known by my online alias **snowyhiker**. I am deeply passionate about technology, particularly in the field of [**penetration testing**](https://www.ibm.com/topics/penetration-testing) and [**cybersecurity**](https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity).

I’ve always been fascinated by how systems work and how they can be made more secure. Over time, this curiosity evolved into a passion for [ethical hacking](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-ethical-hacking?msockid=1eca577a2b62627e27c4424c2acc6316), where I focus on testing and securing digital infrastructures against potential threats.

I believe that in the world of technology, constant learning is key. The more I explore and engage with the field, the more I realize how vast and ever-evolving it is. That’s why I continue to dive deeper into [penetration testing](https://www.ibm.com/topics/penetration-testing), [hacking methodologies](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/pen-testing-methodology), and the latest [security trends](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/preemptive-safety/cyber-security-trends).

When I'm not busy with ethical hacking projects, I enjoy sharing my knowledge and collaborating with others in the tech community. If you're working on a [cybersecurity project](https://www.cybrary.it/), or just need help, feel free to reach out. I’m always excited to connect with like-minded individuals and contribute to meaningful projects.
