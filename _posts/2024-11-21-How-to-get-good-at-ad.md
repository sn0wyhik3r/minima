**Active Directory (AD)** is a Microsoft-developed **directory service** for managing and organizing **users, computers, and resources** within a Windows domain network. It provides **centralized control** for authentication, authorization, and access to network resources through a hierarchical structure of **domains**, **organizational units (OUs)**, and **forests**. With features like **Group Policy**, administrators can enforce security settings and policies across the network. AD is widely used in enterprises for its scalability, security, and ability to integrate with other systems.
