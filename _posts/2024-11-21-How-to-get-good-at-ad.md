**Active Directory (AD)** is a Microsoft directory service designed to **centralize management and control** in Windows domain networks. It organizes resources like **users, computers, groups, and devices** in a hierarchical structure that includes **domains** (basic management units), **Organizational Units (OUs)** (for grouping objects), and **forests** (collections of domains with shared configurations). AD handles **authentication** (verifying user identities) and **authorization** (controlling access to resources) through secure protocols. It enables administrators to enforce security policies, manage permissions, and deploy settings across the network via **Group Policy**. With its **scalability** and integration capabilities, AD is widely used in businesses of all sizes to streamline IT operations.
